And we are.</p></li><li><p>When people are uncomfortable with the present moment, they fidget with their hands or their minds. Watch and see.</p></li><li><p>Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.</p></li><li><p>Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.</p></li><li><p>Credit card debt devours souls.</p></li><li><p>Nobody knows more than a minuscule fraction of what’s going on in the world. It’s just way too big for any one person to know it well.</p></li><li><p>Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.</p></li><li><p>A person who is unafraid to present a candid version of herself to the world is as rare as diamonds.</p></li><li><p>The most common addiction in the world is the draw of comfort.
